## Part 7: Answering Questions About the Code

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

When we want to get the first index of the sequence, where the paremeter should be 0, it goes to the if statement and
throws IllegalArgumentException. So I change the if condition from n <= 0 to n < 0.


2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

It initially fails because when parameter is 0, it goes to the if statement and throws IllegalArgumentException, whereas
the expected output should be 1. I did not have to change anything to fix this issue because I already revised if
condition from n <= 0 to n < 0 from the last question, and therefore it does not go into if statement anymore. Instead,
it goes to else if statement and correctly return 1.


3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

It fails because when parameter is 2, which is the third index, it goes to the else-if statement and return 1, whereas
the expected output should be 2. I change else-if condition from n <= 2 to n < 2, and therefore if n >= 2, it goes to
the else statement that recursively sums previous two sequence numbers instead of entering else-if statement, which was
supposed to be the base case.


## Part 8: Debugger Tutorial

1. What are the values of "x", "y", and "sum" printed by your statement? Why was x not equal 
to the first integer entered here, and how could we fix this?

x = 4, y = 4, sum = 0. x is not correct because we divide first input number by 2 and then times 2, where division
rounds down when it is a decimal, so if 5 is input, 5/2 = 2, and 2*2 = 4, that is why it shows 4 instead of 5. I replace
this redundant computing with just "int x = console.nextInt()", that is directly use integer input as x.


2. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel? What does the “frames” 
tab list as the current method and line number? (Write down the text that was highlighted when 
the Debug perspective first opened.)

x = 3, y = 4
computeSum:43


3. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel after each of the two step overs?

First step over: x = 3, y = 4
Second step over: x = 3, y = 4, sum = -1
